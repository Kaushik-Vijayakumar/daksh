				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>The game is one on one match in which one team competes with the other team.</li>
						<li>The game lasts for 6 minutes.</li>
						<li>One extra minute shall be provided for setting up the robots before the start of the match.</li>
						<li>Only one member of each team is allowed to enter the arena. Only one team member is allowed to control the bot.</li>
						<li>The robots are placed in their respective starting zones before the match starts.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br>
				<div class="big_text">Tasks of the Robot:</div>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>As soon as the match begins, the robot has to descend down the ramp and stand on top of two rails. The task will be completed only if the robot stands successfully on top of the rails without falling down. Or the robots are allowed to start from the end of the ramp with a penalty of 1 minute until which the robot has to stand idle.</li>
						<li>The robot has to pick up one ball from the outer ball zone and place it in the pass zone so that the gate opens.</li>
						<li>Now the robot has to pick up balls from the outer ball zone and place it on top of the ball dropping zone.</li>
						<li>After a minimum of 4 balls has been successfully dropped in the ball dropping zone, the robot can pick up balls from either outer ball zone or inner ball zone or can also steal balls from your opponent’s basket. Each carry different points.</li>
						<li>There will be different colored balls in the inner zone. The outer layer of 12 balls are of green color. Inner 4 balls are of red color. Each carry different points.</li>
						<li>A ball dropped outside the ball zone by the robot cannot be picked again but will be placed back in its initial position after which it can be picked up.</li>
					</ul>

Autonomous bots should be capable of both line following and also wall following. Wall will be of white colour. Line following task has to be done by following black lines on white surface.</p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Round 1:</div>
				<p>Clear the round by making only an autonomous bot of required dimensions and by fulfilling the basic testing of the robot (line following and wall following effectively). The arena will not be complex. It contains black lines with only straight, curved, right angle turns, junctions etc. For the case of wall following curves and right angle turns will not be there.</p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Round 2:</div>
				<p>The arena for round 2 will be disclosed ONLY for the teams which clears the round 1. The arena will be complex with the curves, right angle turns, discontinuous lines, multiple junctions etc. Wall will be in the form of curves and straight path. Time will be given to the selected teams to program their bots. Though manual robot is required for this round, the entire arena can also be completed with the help of autonomous bot alone.</p>

					<p>Copper wire could be cut accordingly as per your design. Effective usage of wire is key to design. Total length is not fixed as your chassis may be suited for coupe, hatchback, sedan, truck or race cars. At same time your wheel base, track and suspension dimensions are vital as the chassis holder (used for testing) is made with these as reference dimension. If your chassis fails in this case, testing cannot be done.
On completion your chassis will be evaluated based on your design. Evaluation based on dimension and load test.</p>
				</p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Dimention Test:</div>
				<p>Chassis is mounted on the chassis holder & dimensions will be measured as per the given specification. Accuracy in dimension earns more points.</p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Load Test:</div>
				<p>The chasse base will be supported on holder with help of your suspension at certain height. It will be made sure that there will no horizontal movement of chassis. Gradually applied loads of 250-500g will be placed on your chasse. A vertical scale is mounted on the chassis holder to measure the deformation due to load. Smaller deformation earns more points.</p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Torsional Rigidity Test:</div>
				<p>Chassis will be locked on the holder with help of clips at certain height. An arm is fixed to the front axle and parallel to it, one end of arm rests freely and other end has provision to carry loads. On applying the load the deflection of arm is measured in the vertical scale mounted on the holder. Smaller deflection earns more points.</p>
				<img src="images/events_desc/rigid.png" align="middle">
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Judgement:</div>
				<p>Points earned by each team divides them, in case of a tie test will be repeated with different loads. Teams are advised to make it simple, finish it off within time and stick to what they are provided with. <br>
Decision made by the organizers is final.

				<p>Have you ever dreamt of guarding your city from external invasions employing biomimetic contraptions and defenses? Or attacking another city using similar mechanisms? Here is your dream coming true! Biomimicry is an event that evaluates contestants based on the number of successful invasions and evasions in the war that follows that creation of the contestants’ respective defenses.The teams go to war after the design and only the all inclusive team can survive to taste the fruit of victory.</p>
				<p>Each team may consist of up to 2 people. <br><br>
				Each team is given a geographic location where they have to design a town, with defenses for protection from attacks, using only biomimetic and bionic contraptions and devices. After the designs are completed, the teams go to war, each team unaware of the others' defenses. Points are awarded for number of successful attacks or successful evasions. Limited number of defenses allowed and all contraptions should be justified in their relevance to biomimetics. Judging will be based on number of points.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="big_text">Round 1:</div>
				<p>participants will be tested based on basic knowledge of Biomimicry and its applications </p>
				<br>
        		<div class="big_text">Round 2:</div>

				<p>The aim is to build a working heat exchanger. Participants will have to procure any materials they may require for construction on their own. A laboratory thermometer will be provided.<br>
				Heat Exchanger should be Batch, i.e. both hot liquid and cold liquid will be filled in the beginning. Care should be taken that the hot and cold fluids do not mix.<bR>
				A mechanism should be provided to fill both hot and cold fluid and to withdraw them at the end of the process. Care should be taken that the difference in volume of hot fluid added and recovered at the end of the process should not exceed 25 ml.<br>
				Water is the hot fluid and a brine solution of specific concentration is the cold fluid. The brine solution will be provided at the same concentration for all teams.<br>
				* Teams will be provided with hot water (2 litres) and brine solution (2 litres). Funnel will be provided for the purpose of filling the liquids into the exchanger. Bore of funnel used will be ½’’ (half an inch). Time taken for filling both the liquids should not exceed 45 seconds.<br>

				* The brine solution (2 litres) will be used as the source of cold fluid.<br>

				* No trial runs will be allowed around the venue of the competition.<br>

				* Any system found unsafe in any way would be disqualified.<br>

				* Run will be for a period of 8 minutes, for each team.<br>

				* Each team can have a maximum of three participants.<br>

				* In case of any problems, organisers’ and judges’ decision is final.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="big_text">Specifications</div>
				<p>

				* The equipment should fit into a box of 40cm*40cm*50 cm.<br>

				* The entire equipment cannot be moved during the run. It must be

				operated while kept on the table.<br>

				* The equipment must be sealed properly, devoid of leakage.<br>

				* Equipment should not contain any chemical (in any physical state)

				that can react/interact with the liquids.<br>

				* Equipment should have provision for entry and exit of cold water,

				and hot fluid. The fluid exits shall only be used at the end of the

				process to withdraw them for measurement purposes.<br>

				* The provisions for entry and exit should be completely closed

				during the run time.
				</p>

				<div class="big_text">JUDGING CRITERIA</div>
				<p>
				* Initial and final temperature of the hot and cold fluid will be

				measured.<bR>

				* Volume of hot fluid in the Heat Exchanger will be measured after

				the run. Water loss will be considered.<bR>

				* Initial Temperature - Ti, Final Temperature - Tf, Mass of hot fluid - m

				Heat Transfer= m (Tf-Ti) Cp<br>

				* Cost of the equipment would also be considered.<br>
